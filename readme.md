# Overview
>>This shows my complete portfolio based on job application built with bootstrap mainly and some other frameworks, it includes Hero section, About me, Skills, Resume and My works section respectively.I implemented javascript frameworks to help out with most of the animations to make it look artisticly simple and user friendly. I used specific wise chosen colors, red, black and white mostly with opacity added to reduce most of them.
